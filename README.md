# Housing price prediction
Machine Learning is seeing its growth more
rapidly in this decade. Many applications and algorithms
evolve in Machine Learning day to day.

One such application found in journals is house price prediction.
House prices are increasing every year which has
necessitated the modeling of house price prediction.
These models constructed, help the customers to purchase
a house suitable for their need. Proposed work makes use
of the attributes or features of the houses such as number
of bedrooms available in the house, age of the house,
travelling facility from the location, school facility
available nearby the houses and Shopping malls available
nearby the house location. 

House availability based on desired features of the house and house price prediction
are modeled in the proposed work and the model is
constructed for a small town in West Godavari district of
Andhrapradesh. 

The work involves decision tree
classification, decision tree regression and multiple linear
regression and is implemented using Scikit-Learn
Machine Learning Tool.
